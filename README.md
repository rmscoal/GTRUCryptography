# GTRUCryptography

**Hello everyone**

### What is this project?
> This project is a Python program for my undergraduate thesis. It is a program to run a NTRU-like cryptography system called GTRU (a Group-based NTRU-like cryptosystem). The intention of this program is to measure the speed of its encryption and decryption process. In addition, it also totals the time with building the key. There are or will be two versions. The first version is under the group Z^n. Meanwhile the second version will be under a poly-Z group. On the last step of this project, the speeds will be compared to RSA, a well-known cryptosystem that is currently being in many security feature as a public-key cryptosystem.

### What do I use in this project?

> For the modules, I used Numpy to do a general mathematical computation. Secondly, I also used Sympy for Extended Euclidean Algorithm, that is to find the inverse of a polynomial in the ring Z_p[x]/<x^N -1>. This will be so useful for increasing the speed of finding the inverse of a matrix.

*That's all there is as of now. Thanks for tuning in!*
